<a id="writing-room-bot" class="anchor" href="#writing-room-bot" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing Room Bot</h1>

<p>A chat bot for <a href="http://www.pokemonshowdown.com/">Pokémon Showdown</a>. This bot has a number of commands, some helpful and some less so, as well as the capability to mod. It only reacts to basic offences such as flooding/caps/stretching.</p>

<h1>
<a id="commands" class="anchor" href="#commands" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Commands</h1>

<p>Below is a list of commands for the bot. Note that this can occasionally become out of date as new commands are created or removed. Text within brackets (or paranthesies, if you're one of "those" people) is text not actually needed to be literally written, but more something that shows you what you should generally write in the space. Semicolons in a command's name indicate alternate names or aliases for the command, which do exactly the same thing as the other names and do not need to be added to the command for it to work; please don't actually type a semicolon in the command, as that is what the Command Character is.</p>

<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p><strong>This is not recommended for beginners!</strong>
Why? Because I'm too lazy to explain everything in detail.</p>

<p>Pokémon Showdown Writing Bot requires <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> to run.
This bot has not been tested on every <code>node.js</code> version possible, but has the same version requirements as <a href="https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown">Pokémon Showdown</a>: either v0.6.3 through v0.8.22, or v0.10.2 and up.
Install <code>node.js</code> if you don't have it yet, try the last stable version.</p>

<p>Next up is cloning this bot. This can be done in two ways: cloning it via <code>git</code> or downloading as ZIP.
Downloading it as ZIP is the easy and lazy way, but is a lot less handy to update than cloning this repository.</p>

<p>To install dependencies, run:</p>

<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you run the above command from within the folder that you would like to run your bot in. Repeat this step for any extra bots you would like to use.
Copy <code>config-example.js</code> and rename it to <code>config.js</code>, then edit the needed variables.
To change the commands that the bot responds to, edit <code>commands.js</code>.</p>

<p>Now, to start the bot, use:</p>

<pre><code>node main.js

or run the file named `run.bat` if you are on a Windows computer. This will not work on Macintosh.
</code></pre>

<p>Some information will be shown, and will automatically join the room(s) you specified if no error occurs.</p>

<a id="development" class="anchor" href="#development" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development</h1>

<p>Everyone is more than welcome to contribute to the bot.
However, please refrain from adding more example commands.</p>
