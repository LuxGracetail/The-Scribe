{"name":"Showdown-writing-bot","tagline":"Pokémon Showdown's Official Writing Room Bot!","body":"Writing Room Bot\r\n====================\r\n\r\nA chat bot for [Pokémon Showdown][1]. This bot has a number of commands, some helpful and some less so, as well as the capability to mod. It only reacts to basic offences such as flooding/caps/stretching.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.pokemonshowdown.com/\r\n\r\nCommands\r\n========\r\nBelow is a list of commands for the bot. Note that this can occasionally become out of date as new commands are created or removed. Text within brackets (or paranthesies, if you're one of \"those\" people) is text not actually needed to be literally written, but more something that shows you what you should generally write in the space. Semicolons in a command's name indicate alternate names or aliases for the command, which do exactly the same thing as the other names and do not need to be added to the command for it to work; please don't actually type a semicolon in the command, as that is what the Command Character is.\r\n\r\nRoom Owners and Above\r\n---------------------\r\n`settings; set`: Toggles which commands can be used or not.\r\n\r\n`js`: Manipulates basic JavaScript functions.\r\n\r\n`do <text>`: Forces the bot to type whatever text is entered after `do`.\r\n\r\n`reload`: Reloads the bot's commands, adding any updates without having to reboot it entirely.\r\n\r\n`clearmail <optional user> (or) all`: Used to delete all stored messages from either a certain user or everybody's respectively.\r\n\r\nModerators and Above\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n`blacklist; ban; ab`: Used to add a user to the bot's autoban list.\r\n\r\n`unblacklist; unban; unab`: Used to remove a user from the bot's autoban list.\r\n\r\n`rab regexab; regexautoban`: Used to ban any user with a particular string of letters in their name; use [Regular Expressions.][6]\r\n\r\n`unrab; unregexab; regexautoban`: Used to remove the string set with the `rab` command.\r\n\r\n`vab; viewbans; viewautobans; viewblacklist`: Used to get the bot to Private Message you with a list of every autobanned user.\r\n\r\n`banphrase; banword`: Used to set a particular word as \"banned\", meaning that the bot will mute on the sight of it.\r\n\r\n`unbanphrase; unbanword`: Used to undo the above.\r\n\r\n`viewbannedphrases; viewbannedwords ;vab`: Used to get the bot to Private Message the sender a list of every banned phrase or word.\r\n\r\n`announce on/off`: Used to toggle the state of the announcements for the room.

Because I'm too lazy to explain everything in detail.\r\n\r\nPokémon Showdown Writing Bot requires [node.js][2] to run.\r\nThis bot has not been tested on every `node.js` version possible, but has the same version requirements as [Pokémon Showdown][3]: either v0.6.3 through v0.8.22, or v0.10.2 and up.\r\nInstall `node.js` if you don't have it yet, try the last stable version.\r\n\r\nNext up is cloning this bot. This can be done in two ways: cloning it via `git` or downloading as ZIP.\r\nDownloading it as ZIP is the easy and lazy way, but is a lot less handy to update than cloning this repository.\r\n\r\nTo install dependencies, run:\r\n\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\nMake sure you run the above command from within the folder that you would like to run your bot in. Repeat this step for any extra bots you would like to use.\r\nCopy `config-example.js` and rename it to `config.js`, then edit the needed variables.\r\nTo change the commands that the bot responds to, edit `commands.js`.\r\n\r\nNow, to start the bot, use:\r\n\r\n    node main.js\r\n    \r\n    or run the file named `run.bat` if you are on a Windows computer. This will not work on Macintosh.\r\n\r\nSome information will be shown, and will automatically join the room(s) you specified if no error occurs.\r\n\r\n  [2]: http://nodejs.org/\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown\r\n  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n===========\r\n\r\nEveryone is more than welcome to contribute to the bot.\r\nHowever, please refrain from adding more example commands.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n - TalkTakesTime (Original Bot and a bit of troubleshooting)\r\n - Quinella (Original Bot)\r\n - Morfent (Modified Original Bot)\r\n - AxeBane (Owner)\r\n - sirDonovan (Our wonderful VPN Host~ <3) Love ya, Dono.\r\n - Solarisfox (Development)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nPokémon Showdown Bot is distributed under the terms of the [MIT License][5].\r\n\r\n  [5]: https://github.com/Quinella/Pokemon-Showdown-Bot/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
